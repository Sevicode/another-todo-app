* In progress right now! stay tuned :D


I decided to learn **TypeScript** by building applications instead of watching tutorials so I created this little beginner friendly **TODO** app with **react** and **TypeScript**. 

It is not uploaded anywhere and to use it you will need to install the following:

* [npm]((https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

To start the app run ``` npm start ``` in your terminal.
